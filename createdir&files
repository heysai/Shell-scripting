#./test.sh Demo 2
#it will create a dir called Demo and inside that it will create files.if the dir already exists it wont create dir
EBS and Linux	"Write the shell script that 

1) Create new directory and 
2) Add three files within created directory 
3) rename all files in the current directory that end in “.txt” to end
with today’s date in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD. 
4) display all filenames within directory as output

Execute bash file and remove created directory and files outside

For example, if i have 3 files (one file name is test_1.txt) in the current directory and
 today is May 26,2022 it would change name from 
“test.txt” to “test_1_2022–05–26.txt”."
